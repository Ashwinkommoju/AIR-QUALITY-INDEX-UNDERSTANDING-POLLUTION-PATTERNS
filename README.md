# AIR-QUALITY-INDEX-UNDERSTANDING-POLLUTION-PATTERNS
Air pollution is a growing environmental concern that significantly impacts public 
health and climate. Understanding pollution patterns through data analytics is crucial for 
informed decision-making and effective mitigation strategies. It aims to develop an 
interactive Power BI dashboard, seamlessly integrated into a Streamlit web application, to 
visualize air quality trends across different regions and timeframes. The project involves 
collecting, preprocessing, and structuring historical air quality and meteorological data to 
enable comprehensive analysis of AQI variations. The dashboard will provide an intuitive 
and user-friendly interface for environmental analysts, policymakers, researchers, and the 
general public, offering real time and historical insights into air pollution levels, regional 
disparities, and influencing factors. By leveraging data visualization techniques, the 
platform will allow users to explore trends, identify pollution hotspots, and assess the 
impact of environmental factors on air quality. The web application will enhance 
accessibility, enabling users to interact with data dynamically and derive actionable 
insights. The project will undergo rigorous testing to ensure accuracy, reliability, and 
responsiveness. Additionally, detailed documentation will be provided to support future 
enhancements and usability. This initiative aims to empower stakeholders with data-driven 
insights, facilitating more effective air pollution control policies, public awareness, and 
sustainable urban planning solutions.
